<p id="FuryLetter">Anasatri:</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">I write to you today with the hope that you would be interested in joining me for a &lsquo;research opportunity&rsquo; near Surt. I believe this topic would be something within both of our interests.</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">A few seasons ago, your scouts (who were kindly assisting us with exploration of our area) came across an unexpected lake of lava in the hills to our Northwest. Those scouts reported spotting a &lsquo;scaled figure&rsquo; lurking somewhere within the lava. Since then, further explorers (as well as the prospectors, rangers, and hunters that travel across our lands) have reported more ostensible sightings of the scaled, lava-dwelling behemoth. There have been no verified sightings -- and even the unverified ones report little beyond &lsquo;large scaled creature in lava&rsquo; and &lsquo;strange movements to the northwest. That said, the lack of any actual evidence has done little to stop the rumors.</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">We have made a few official exploration attempts on our part, but the ongoing conflict with Coyote and the Coldwater elves have limited what resources we could send. For my part, my arcane team and I have conducted a full material scan of the lava lake via ritual magic, but have found no evidence of a den of any sort (or of any pockets of air below the surface). But this&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t sit right with me. Just because we haven&rsquo;t seen evidence of a den doesn&rsquo;t mean there isn&rsquo;t one, and just because we haven&rsquo;t seen any sign of breathable air below the surface doesn&rsquo;t mean a creature that doesn&rsquo;t breathe air (or receives its air via magic) can&rsquo;t live there.</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">I&rsquo;ve tried looking for our neighbor from long distance, and thusfar haven&rsquo;t even found proof he has a house. I think its time to try knocking on his door with a box of cookies. And, since you&rsquo;re something of a scholarly expert (and thus might have a better idea of what could live in a nearby lava lake than I do, and how to talk to it), I thought you might be interested as well.</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">I&rsquo;m sending a copy of this letter to our mutual friend Ink, of the Cryptid Elves, in the hopes that he would also be interested. It's not every day you get to meet a dragon (maybe?), right?</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">With utmost sincerity,&nbsp;</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">The Fury</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>The Fury dropped neatly onto the stool in front of her armoire, set her mask on the workstand beside it, and pulled open the traveling satchel she&rsquo;d set aside for the trip. The letter to Anasatri should be arriving in the morning, based on the normal speed of flappymail between Surt and the southern cities, and even if it had arrived early it would be a few days before the flying scholar could reply back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fury was already packed. She was excited, and she knew it.</p>
<p>She sorted through the satchel for a third time -- counting clothes, checking spell components, and making sure her notebooks were securely sealed in fire-resistant bags -- and then yawned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She glanced over at the mirror set into her armoire. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a mess, dear,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;Time for a bath before bed, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood and walked over to the bathing brazier set into the far side of the room, and shoved a few oil-soaked logs onto the pyramid rack at the brazier&rsquo;s center. She flicked her fingers at the brazier&rsquo;s base, sending a cascade of sparks into it, and then pulled off her fuzzy pajama shirt and tossed it onto the bath&rsquo;s divider screen.</p>
<p>"Helllooo-uh-ack!"</p>
<p>With a sound like a cat choking on a hairball, Ink announced his presence in the room with Anasatri in tow. He nearly slapped a hand over his eyes and made a grumbling sound.</p>
<p>"Sorry!" He winced. His cheeks turned slightly greyer.</p>
<p>Anasatri glanced up at him and back to Fury, smiling and waving cheerfully, &ldquo;Hi! I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve officially met before.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"YEEEEP!"</p>
<p>The Fury leapt for her pajama shirt, keeping one hand over her face. Her right hand hooked a sleeve; the rest of her slammed hard into a wooden screen, sending herself and the whole divider toppling to the floor.</p>
<p>After a second, she draped her shirt over her head, and scrambled to her feet.</p>
<p>"G-good evening, Anasatrii," she said in Satri's general direction. "And you're right, we haven&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you. I assume Ink is here as well?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a rattling sighing noise from Ink that might be an acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Fury gave the room an elegant bow, somewhat ruined by her blinding glow, and the now-steadily-charring tie-dyed pajamas covering her face.</p>
<p>"...Would someone be so kind as to hand me my mask? It&rsquo;s on the armoire, by the mirror."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri looked around and spotted it, putting it in Fury&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Guess we aren&rsquo;t supposed to see your face, huh? And yes, Ink&rsquo;s here. Are you all right? That was a bit of a fall.&rdquo; She paused, &ldquo;Ah, also your shirt is on fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thank you," Fury replied. She slipped the mask underneath her shirt, and pulled the pajamas down over her shoulders a moment later, mask firmly in place. "I'm all right. I just... wasn't expecting you until tomorrow. At least."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She patted at a few charred spots on her pajama bottoms, not noticing the face burnt into the back of her shirt. "Thank you for showing up so... promptly! I was really hoping you two would be interested! The rumors have been going on for quite a while, and since the first sighting came from the Flappy Scouts -- and they were so amazing at scouting the rest of the terrain -- so there has to be something living in there!"</p>
<p>"...It&rsquo;s a bit late, but I'm already packed..." She yawned, and gestured to the satchel sitting beside her armoire. "If you can give me just a few minutes to get cleaned up, we can go ahead and get started! ...Oh, and we'll have to visit the kitchens before we leave."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those scout reports were <em>all</em> the gossip in Asavardi. They had tons of stories to tell about their stay up here.&rdquo; Anasatri patted Ink&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;You can look now; she has her mask back on.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>And</em> my shirt,&rdquo; the Fury said.</p>
<p>Ink slowly peeked from between his fingers and lowered his hands. He looked to Fury with drooping ears.</p>
<p>"... Sorry," he rasped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's all right," the Fury replied, smiling. "You've seen me without it already, anyway."</p>
<p>"...Without my mask, I mean," she said, glancing over to Anasatri. "...In fact, forget I said that entirely -- so the scouts were already talking about it, you said? What do you think it is? Is there anything we need to bring? I was going to get some supplies and a tin of plakouscake. Maybe I should get gold from the treasury. Is that appropriate? Would traveling there by magic be rude?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri&rsquo;s wings shivered from the effort of not laughing out loud. &ldquo;I guess I should ask what we&rsquo;re actually doing?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"To be honest, I thought we would go over to the lava lake and examine it ourselves," the Fury said. "Maybe look around for evidence of what could be living there, use divination to take a look for it, or just generally try to get its attention. Whatever lives there isn't going out of its way to be noticed, but clearly isn't avoiding attention that hard, either. I imagine if we march to the lakeside and look around for long enough, we'll find some evidence we can use to eventually identify it, or even talk to it."</p>
<p>Ink tilted his head at Fury, &ldquo;But what if you&rsquo;re right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Then we say hi, I introduce myself as one of the new neighbors, and we present it 'tribute' in the form of plakouscake and conversation. Or we run for it and ask the Terror to deal with it later. I'm hoping for the former."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri blinked, &ldquo;Oh. Well! Hopefully the first one, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"And... well, I'm a decent spellslinger, but I'm not much of a scholar. Seriously not. I've been working on this for months, but my ideas on what could be living in there are vague... and mostly guesswork. This requires an expert, and Anasatri, I've heard your the best. And you already made clear at the last potluck that you're an expert at reading patterns. If anyone can determine what could be living there, where, and how to find out about it, you can.</p>
<p>"And Ink, you're the best spellcaster I know, and you are really insightful, and like secrets. I thought you might enjoy finding out what's living there -- and maybe meeting it, if its friendly enough. And I kinda also assumed that of the three of us, you're probably the least likely to get killed, and the most likely to be able to get help."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I can also fly over and see if I can see.&rdquo; She tapped her lip, &ldquo;Who knows maybe dropping your idea of tribute into the middle of the lava lake might get its attention. <em>Assuming</em> it&rsquo;s, you know, intelligent.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Perfect! We can head over there and take a look whenever you're ready." Fury yawned. "...Though I wouldn't mind waiting until morning, if you want. It&rsquo;s not a long journey, however; only a few days travel. And the roads in that direction... aren't really there yet, so that might make it take a little longer."</p>
<p>Ink glanced back and forth between the two elves as they talked. He waited for Fury to finish speaking, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t take long. Morning is&hellip; fine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning would be nice for me too,&rdquo; Anasatri said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been, ah, staying up too late and not exactly sleeping enough lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; Ink stated rather bluntly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky&hellip;&rdquo; Anasatri groaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to not need to sleep&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He tilted his head again, not really at anything, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t dream&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm, true. I&rsquo;ve been having some <em>wild</em> dreams lately, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d want to do without it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he turned toward her slightly, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"I would," the Fury said. "...Let me put on some actual clothing, and we can go arrange for some rooms for the night. They might be a little dusty since it&rsquo;s short notice, but I'm certain we can come up with something."</p>
<p>She dashed over to the armoire, pulled a loose chiton free from a lower drawer, and began trading her pajama shirt for it, keeping her back to Ink and Anasatri. "Is there anything you two think you might need before we leave? Or for the night? I can have something sent up from the kitchen -- the chef lives in some rooms right next to it, and it doesn't take very long to get a fire started."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri fidgeted with one of her feathers, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say no to something to eat, but I don&rsquo;t want to disturb anyone&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; Ink rumbles, &ldquo;Have all I need. Notes about the creature?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury slipped the chiton down over her waist, scooting her pajama bottoms down with it, and off her legs. She turned back to Anasatri, and smiled. "Well, now I have to wake him; he'd never let me hear the end of it if I didn't. Chefs in this town take their jobs <em>so</em> seriously, it's scary."</p>
<p>She bent down to her satchel, and pulled out a thin leather bag, wrapped in paper and wax. She pulled it open, revealing a pile of parchment, and then handed the bag over to Ink. "Everything we have on every sighting," she said. "I had packed it up for safe keeping. Feel free to browse through it; I'll be back in just a few minutes."</p>
<p>She gave Anastri and Ink a nod, and then scampered out the door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The next morning, the Fury met Ink and Anasatri in a small dining hall where the two had been offered breakfast. She had changed out her chiton for thick woolen traveler's garb and a shiny silk cape, and had the satchel from yesterday tucked over one shoulder.</p>
<p>"Eat a hearty breakfast," she said. "For tonight, we dine on the Marr. I have enough food for a week for each of us, several notebooks, some camping supplies, and of course some sweets we can bribe potentially friendly ginormous reptiles with. And a few gold and platinum pieces, just in case."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really are expecting a dragon, aren&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Anasatri said. There was a plate of mostly demolished food in front of her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a dragon before.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury shrugged. "Neither have I, but it's the only thing I can think of that is large, scaly, and likely to bathe in lava. And if it's not a dragon... well, hopefully whatever it is can still be bribed."</p>
<p>"I've met one," Ink pipes up after having eaten in silence so far, "Once. Also, not reptiles."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh, really? What kind of dragon&rdquo; Anasatri asks, food forgotten.</p>
<p>"Black." He pauses, "I think. Odd circumstances. Hard to tell."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri props her chin in her hands, &ldquo;We do have plenty of stories about dragons. There were fairy dragons that lived in our forest, and people say they were friendly. I never got to meet one; I hope they made it out ok&hellip;&rdquo; She trails off, looking at whatever is inside her head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ink gives her a sympathetic look before speaking, "Dragons are&hellip; alien. Aloof. Pride is&hellip; not the right word. Their belief in their own superiority is intrinsic, a part of their being, even when good natured. We should be careful."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right, not reptiles," Fury said. "They're... umm... related to birds and sauropods and things like that, right? And I agree. We're not going there to cause a fight, and... I'm not really going to argue with it about superiority, considering it is probably much larger than I am, and can clearly swim in lava. We'll be cautious, we'll be friendly, and we'll probably want to leave in a hurry if it decides not to be neighborly."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>"If you wish," Ink looks between the other two elves, "I am prepared. I will place us close, but not so close it might believe we are&hellip;" he grumbles, "... adventurers."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;Right, we can just get there. And that&rsquo;s a great idea, Ink; in fact, you could even bring us in from a direction away from Surt, so it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily know we just came from here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I can do that," he nods, "Allow me to ready myself."</p>
<p>Ink stands and begins to cast. His tattoos swirl as he layers several protective spells on himself. After a few moments, he is surrounded by a twisting aura of magic. Without waiting for a response, he reaches out to the other two elves.</p>
<p>"Keep your eyes closed," is the only warning he gives.</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>The shadow plane whips by the group like a cold stream before they are suddenly dropped into the hot, acrid air of the Maar. Ink steps back, still protected by a veil of shadows. He has placed the group behind a low outcropping near the edge of the lava pit, a short walk away. The nearly kilometer wide lake of lava bubbles in the distance, promising unpleasant heat even for a fire elf. Even with a black crust of cooling magma on the top, the heat can be felt from here. Ink steps back from the other two elves and glances at Fury.</p>
<p>"Your lead."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri spread her wings with a quiet &lsquo;oof&rsquo;. &ldquo;Wow, Mari and I flew over here after the potluck, but it&rsquo;s so different on the ground!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury nodded. "It's a bit bigger in person."</p>
<p>She swept around the edge of the outcropping, and stepped a little closer to the edge of the pit. Her eyes darted around the edges of the lake, looking for slopes or obvious access points. Or large, scaly creatures, of course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The surface of the lake roils and sloshes. Fury can see that the edges of the lake are closer to sheer cliffs, with almost a 40 foot drop into the lava itself. Peering out over the unstable surface, she can see something&hellip; maybe? A spot of movement in the bubbling lava that might not match the rest. She isn't sure, but something might be out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She kept her eyes on the spot moving through the lava, and stepped a little closer to the edge of the lake. "Hello?" she tried -- first in common, and then in draconic. Then she turned back to Ink and Anasatri. "There is definitely something moving down there -- I can just barely see it, but it's really far down there."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri ruffled her feathers, &ldquo;Want me to go take a look? I&rsquo;m not sure how low I&rsquo;ll be able to fly safely, unless you have any spells to take the edge off of the heat? I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I do," Ink adds, "Might be safer for Fury, with the heat. I prepared flight. One or both of you could go." He looks back and forth between them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury nodded. "All of my spells... sort of do the opposite of 'actually protecting people from fire'. But flight is a good idea, and if Anasatri and I both fly over it, we can back each other up."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good to me. Flight by magic will probably minimize the disruptions from the air currents? Maybe, I don&rsquo;t know how that works actually. But! Two sets of eyes are better than one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Three," Ink's tattoos swirl along his back and shadows in the vague shape of wings spread behind him.</p>
<p>"Already cast mine," Ink says as a smirk escapes his normally flat demeanor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He turns towards Anasatri and mutters another spell, touching her and them himself. Anasatri feels a cooling sensation as a thin layer of darkness protects her from the heat. Ink then turns to Fury and begins to cast again.</p>
<p>He touches her back. Shadowy wings like his spread behind her.</p>
<p>"Your wings last about ten minutes. We sh-"</p>
<p>Suddenly orange light the color of Fury's magic leaps down the illusory wings, wreathing them in flame instead of the shadow Ink had placed. He steps back with a choking noise of surprise.</p>
<p>"I&hellip; I didn't do that." He looks her over, "Visual effect&hellip; spell is as normal. Your aura? Hrm."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury blinked. She pulled her wings forward to get a good look, and then spun around, waving them through the hot volcanic air. "Wow..." she said. "I... wow. I guess so? I've... I don't think I've seen it catch onto someone else's spell before. They look <em>amazing</em>."</p>
<p>She waved them through the air again, and then leapt upward, shooting thirty feet straight up, before doing a quick circle over Anasatri and Ink. "<em>This is amazing</em>!" She turned back over to the other two. "And you just get to do this all the time?" she said to Anasatri. "I mean, of course you can, but -- this is so amazing! I'm so jealous!"</p>
<p>Fury did another quick swivel around the two of them, narrowly avoiding a crash into the ground. "Are you two ready?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri laughed and leaped upward, her very physical wings kicking up a cloud of dust and vapor. The heavy, hot air filled her wings and carried her up effortlessly to where Fury was circling. Her hands flicked rapidly through the winged elves&rsquo; sign language before she remembered Fury probably didn&rsquo;t know it. &ldquo;It <em>is</em> amazing! You&rsquo;ll have a hard time going back to the ground after this. But be careful when you go down! You <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to crash!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right, right," Fury said. "Is there a trick to it? Maybe a better angle to approach the ground from?" She swiveled back around, and tried to hit the ground feet first, managing a stumbling stop right before she would have collided with Ink. "I think I've <em>kind of</em> got this," she said, grinning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of like swimming, but&hellip; faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ink has an expression that might be a smile, and he rubs his chin as he looks at Fury.</p>
<p>"Hm. Fascinating. Like they are meant to be there. Still. Not like real wings. Heh. User-friendly. Just don't hit the ground. Easy."</p>
<p>Ink's shadowy wings spread slightly and he raises up off the ground without making a sound. He pauses, then swoops upwards into the air. With a level of grace worthy of Shadimon, he tilts backwards and dives upside down. He twists and lands again in front of Fury without even a whisper of a sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"See?" Ink has what is definitely a smile, "Easy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury swallowed, a hint of heat crawling up her face. "Umm... wow."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri laughed and swooped back down, buffeting them with wind as she landed. &ldquo;Ink if you ever do that around Asavardi, people will never leave you alone! We do love some fancy flying.&rdquo; She walked around him to peer at the shadowy wings, and then looked over to Fury, &ldquo;There are tricks to it, sure, but for us it&rsquo;s all, you know, physical. Do the magic wings work just...by thought? But, Fury, best advice is look where you want to go. Angle of your body is the best way to steer.&rdquo; She laughed again, &ldquo;And it will keep you from veering into a tree by accident.&rdquo; She fluffed her feathers and grinned, &ldquo;Shall we go take a look at your neighbor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ink gives Fury a curious look, but then nods to Anasatri, "Yes. Time is a factor."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time, Anasatri took a running leap off the edge of the ridge, jumping into the rising thermals and shooting upward.</p>
<p>"After you." Ink makes a sweeping gesture at the lava lake to Fury.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're most gracious," Fury said, smiling. She followed Anasatri, dashing to the top of the ridge and jumping off into the air. She twirled in midair, before stretching out her wings, and pulling into a tight loop that left her level about 40 feet above the ground. Ink chuckles and follows.</p>
<p>There is a blast of heat as the elves take flight over the lake of lava, so much so that it can be felt even through their magic resistances. Flying as low as they dare, they scan the area where Fury saw movement. Sure enough, there are spatters of hot yellow on the cooler red surface lava and places where the chunks of cooled black rock have been broken up. Something has broken the surface near here.</p>
<p><em>I am seeing traces of magic,</em> a message spell comes from Ink, <em>Conjuration. Recent.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>So it may not be local</em>, Fury replied via a message of her own. <em>Or it summoned some sentries to keep an eye out for it. I'm not seeing anything... but maybe if I get a little closer, I might</em>. She angled herself down, dropping to 20' above the surface of the lake, and cast Detect Magic. Sure enough, there's a faint aura of conjuration. As Fury examines it, it slowly fades to nothing. An aura like that is too weak to have summoned anything significant and was definitely not a powerful enough travel spell to have left the lava. It would have to be a lower level spell, and whoever cast it is probably still around. Regardless, her detection cannot penetrate the surface of the lava.</p>
<p>As Fury dipped lower, Anasatri tilted her wings and drifted higher, scanning the surface of the lava lake further out from the site of the disturbance. She was keeping her eyes open for any other shifts or changes in the cracked surface. The area around seemed calm, with no other signs that anything had recently surfaced in the immediate area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>It could have been a low-power summoning spell</em>, Fury messaged. <em>Or some kind of obscuring effect</em>. Whatever it was, it was recent. She arched her back, angling to gain back altitude. <em>Maybe we can make some noise to get its attention. Really knock on its door a bit.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Is that the best idea?</em> Anasatri asked. <em>We at least will want to be higher up first.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury nodded. <em>Let&rsquo;s get to at least seventy feet up and consider our options</em>.</p>
<p><em>With you.</em> Ink followed them up.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m almost afraid to ask what your idea of &lsquo;knocking on its door&rsquo; is,</em> Anasatri said, circling higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A fireball forty feet above the surface of the lake</em>, Fury replied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri silently shifted her wings and went higher.</p>
<p><em>If it's in lava&hellip; </em>Ink's voice comes through, <em>Fireball will be no issue.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not trying to hit it! Just make a lot of noise!</em> Fury sent back. <em>Fireball is loud!</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Yours</em></strong><em> are.</em> Is Ink being&hellip; sarcastic?&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Not all of us get to use Silent Spell on everything so they can sneak up on people</em>, Fury replied with a visible huff.</p>
<p>There is an odd rasping noise in Ink's message before he continues,<em> Very well. Go ahead, fight fire with fire.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A red-orange-purple spark shot out from Fury's fingertips, exploding into a brilliant ball of flame forty feet above the surface of the lava lake.</p>
<p>There is a splatter as a wave of lava ripples away from the explosion. As the noise fades, the surface of the lava settles. It falls still.</p>
<p>Seconds later, the surface rumbled and bubbled upwards. There was a splash of lava that did not quite reach the flying elves as a bolt of golden scales shot upwards from the lake.</p>
<p>A long, though barely larger than a stout horse, graceful dragon with golden colored scales took to the wing from the lava. Its yellow eyes snapped, looking around.</p>
<p>"WHO DARES!?" It bellowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hi!" the Fury said, hovering down to be slightly below level with it. "Sorry to bother you, your grace, but... you didn't exactly have a door knocker, and I wanted to introduce myself. I'm one of your new neighbors."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dragon swooped around her giving her a quizzical look, "A bold action, for one so small." It glanced at her, and then the two elves hovering higher as it flew in lazy loops around the group, "Thou art elves? Even the long umbral one there?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri glanced at Ink with wide eyes before summoning up a smile and waving to the dragon, &ldquo;Hello! Yes we&rsquo;re all elves. The two of us up here are friends, not immediate neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Oh? Splendid! I had hoped my vassals would be elves! You last so much longer!" It wiggles its claws in excitement, "If you will, who art thou?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I am the Fury, your grace," the Fury said, performing a twirling curtsy in midair with surprising grace. "Of the Fire Elves of Surt. How may we address you?"</p>
<p>The dragon bares its teeth and dips its head in a midair bow. "A pleasure to meet thee, Fury of the Fire Elves. You may address me as <strong>Ankkharavathyr the Magnificent</strong>." He speaks his name with such ridiculously unnecessary pomposity it requires a different font.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ankkharavathyr the Magnificent," the Fury said in Draconic, as if carefully feeling the name out. "The pleasure is mine. ...My lord, we were planning on carving a road near your lair here, as part of expanding the holdings of our kingdom. We wanted to forewarn you, and ask for your permission -- after all, we wouldn't want to disturb you with the work, or with travelers passing near your lands. Would you allow this, in your magnanimity?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dragon raises a shiny eyebrow at her, "Thine words are as fair as thine visage, Fury, but I doubt their intent. Prey tell, what are you <em>really </em>doing here?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury's smile turned a little more apologetic. "Well... there were a lot of rumors that something was living in this lava lake, but no one had any proof... and I wanted to meet a dragon, your grace. And we really were planning on putting a road nearby; we wanted to make sure that if there was anything living here, it wouldn't storm out on the regular to assault travelers. The Terror was going to head this way with a platoon of soldiers, but I thought that might be a bit rude. And I really am absolutely delighted to meet you, and I think we can work out a pretty reasonable arrangement between neighbors, as it were. Particularly if you can tell us something about the lava system beneath the Marr, because I think we would all rather it didn't detonate anytime soon."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<em>Neighbors,</em>" he slowly rattled the word, "So, you do not wish for my patronage as vassals?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...That might not be the best idea at the moment," the Fury said. "Some time in the future, maybe, but to be honest my people just finished an apocalyptic war with an enslaving Lycan Empire, and it&rsquo;s hard to make them sit still and accept government as it is. You... probably wouldn't want them to be vassals yet anyway. But neighbors, and maybe friends? We have a lot of potential trade goods -- including some from far away thanks to other Elf Nations in the area -- and with the road and the new settlement we're building, we'll have more still. And even if you say no, we're not going to try and push you out or anything. We'll just try to stay out of your way."</p>
<p>"Drat," the dragon grumbled, "I was hoping for more vassals. Very well, Fury. You came to parlay, so parlay we shall."</p>
<p><em>Two minutes </em>Ink warned with a message.</p>
<p>"...Do you mind if we parlay on the shore? I'm not naturally able to fly, and I don't think I'd be able to swim in lava well either."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ah, of course," the dragon's tone had become more polite again, "I shall follow you. I am eager to hear more of my new&hellip; neighbors."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fury zipped back to the ridge they had started from, looping and weaving regularly, intent on getting as much out of the fly spell as she could before it ended. She touched down at the top of the ridge, and turned to face her companions and Ankkh as they came down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She waited for Ankkh to land, and then turned towards him. &ldquo;...Let&rsquo;s go back a second. You said <em>more</em> vassals? ...Do we have more neighbors that we don&rsquo;t know about?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dragon landed gracefully, curling its tail around itself and sitting with regal posture. Ankkh inclined his head to Fury, "Ah, yes. I have established my lair far to the west of here, in a place formerly known as Fool's Fortune Mine. Lo, to my gratitude, the mine was full of wretched souls who had taken refuge from those foul beasts. I have claimed the mine as my lair, and those therein as my vassals. It is&hellip; modest by a dragon's counting, but a lair nonetheless. But ah, we have hardly begun!"</p>
<p>He turns to Anasatri, "What of you? Thy wings, they are real? A <em>winged </em>elf?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anasatri spreads her wings, showing off the bright patterns painted onto her creamy feathers, &ldquo;I am, yes. We&rsquo;re allies of the fire elves.&rdquo; She shamelessly stares up at him, taking in his glittering scales, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you haven&rsquo;t seen one of us before. But then again, I&rsquo;ve never seen one of <em>you</em> before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Marvelous! Simply marvelous! Winged elves would make absolutely splendid vassals!" He pauses, "but do you see that the same way as your fire elf friend?"</p>
<p>Anasatri fidgeted with a bracelet, &ldquo;It...sort of. Like Fury said, we <em>all</em> just finished a war fighting for our own freedom. We&rsquo;d happily be friends with anyone who&rsquo;s friendly back, but vassals...it&rsquo;s too close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dragon watches her carefully, then places a claw on the ground and lowers his head in a bow, "I would not disrespect the noble sacrifices of those who fought such savage beasts for their freedom."</p>
<p>He turns to Ink, "And what of you, shadowmage? Who art thou?"</p>
<p>"I am Ink," Ink replies flatly.</p>
<p>"No you aren't." The dragon's eyes narrow.</p>
<p>Ink doesn't flinch as he takes a step towards the dragon, "I am no one's slave. I am no one's vassal. You are not my master, wyrm," he takes a few steps forward as his tattoos swirl on his skin. He stops less than a foot from the dragon, tall enough to meet him eye to eye.</p>
<p>"And you," Ink speaks, "<em>may call me</em> Ink."</p>
<p>The dragon met Ink's gaze for several seconds. He leaned forward, unblinking.</p>
<p>And then the dragon&hellip; giggled?</p>
<p>"Superb!" Ankkharavathyr laughed, "Such valor! Such nobility! Such enigmatic poise! Very well, shadowmage, keep your secrets. I have time."</p>
<p>"So do I." Ink turns and walks back, standing next to Anasatri.</p>
<p>"Ah," the dragon sighs, "I had hoped for vassals, but I suppose neighbors is what I have found. Very well. Fury&hellip; tell me more about the fire elves! Not boring trade goods, but tell me more of who you are!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so the Fury did -- of the Conflagration of Muspelham, of the campaigns of the Rebellion, of the Tourist Invasion, of how annoyingly hazardous the Marr is, and of the Coyote Elves to the South and the Tribute of Surt, as well as of the Ashen and the Firedancers, and their rising competitors the Phoenix Imperialis. She left out some details -- more personal ones than anything -- but even so, it was likely more than enough for Ankkharavathyr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Fury finally trailed off, Anasatri - having paid close attention to the details she hadn&rsquo;t been previously aware of - glanced up at Ankkharavathyr, &ldquo;You mentioned the Fool&rsquo;s Fortune mine, and there being people there. Who are they? Humans? Other elves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Fury is finished, Ankkharavathyr actually claps his claws together, "Marvelous! Splendid! Spectacular! Such a harrowing tale! You have been on quite the journey, Fury! I am absolutely enthralled by it! I am also mortified to learn that such foul brigands exist in your lands. Of course, if you had accepted my patronage perhaps I could help&hellip; but ah, you stride upon your own path."</p>
<p>When Anasatri speaks, Ankkh turns to her, waving a claw deferentially, "Humans, mostly. They are suitable vassals, if a touch mundane. Though there are a few elves! They certainly needed my aid. The fools running the mine before the war had no idea what they were doing," he scoffs, "Anasatri, could you tell me more about the winged elves?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, we&rsquo;re originally from a forest that used to be in the west&hellip;&rdquo; She talks about their original home, their part in the War, and a bit about their new home. She isn&rsquo;t as detailed as Fury, but focuses more on their past and their hopes for the future.</p>
<p>As soon as she is finished, Ankk wiggles his claws appreciatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stunning! Superb! Simply <em>scin</em>tillating! Such a tale of sorrow and hope! Verily, I would be moved to tears if I had tear ducts. And those dastardly coyotes, plaguing you as well! Such villains! Ah, but your nobility has brought some of them along, it sounds like! Such poise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Annkh turns to Ink, he places a claw on his chest and inclines his head respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, umbral elf. I understand I may have been rude to you, but I would love to hear more of your people and your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re elves,&rdquo; Ink states with a bland look on his face.</p>
<p>Ankkh rolls his wrist in a &lsquo;please continue&rsquo; motion, &ldquo;And&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call us cryptids,&rdquo; Ink states.</p>
<p>Ankkharavathyr makes a defeated sigh and slumps his shoulders, &ldquo;Well, I suppose I should have expected as such. Very well, cryptid, I will respect thy desire for privacy. I am, truthfully, <em>mighty</em> curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Ink states in a very flat voice.</p>
<p>Ankkh sighs perhaps a touch overly dramatic, &ldquo;Enigmas remain, then. Well&hellip; Fury, of Surt the city of Bronze, I believe we can make an arrangement as&hellip; <em>neighbors</em>. Truth be told, this is not my home. I simply came for a, ah, bath. It&rsquo;s so hard to find such fresh lava from so deep, you see. Tantalizing!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I understand entirely," Fury said. "And I'm a little envious; lava is a little too hot for me, unfortunately, but the heat from the lake feels amazing all the way over here. But I suppose that means you won't mind if we set up a road near your bathing spot? If you want, we can even look into connecting you and your vassals to the local trade network -- our allies, the River Elves, are spectacular merchants, and have been kindly helping all of the Elf Nations in the region with trade and transportation. I doubt they would complain about having new neighbors to visit."</p>
<p>"A road would be no bother, verily! I would be delighted to establish trade with your allies. I am always interested in expanding my hoard, and if they are half as lovely as you I would be delighted to meet them." He pauses, tapping a claw on the ground, "I shall send an envoy with examples of that which my mine is able to produce. I would be loathe to part with some of the most delectable gemstones, but there are plenty of less palatable ores. Yes, splendid."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;In that case, we should probably leave you to enjoy your bath.&rdquo; She glanced back at Ink and Anasatri. &ldquo;It has been an honor, Ankkharavathyr the Magnificent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pleasure, Fury, Anasatri&hellip; and <em>Ink,</em>&rdquo; The dragon bows, still giving Ink the side eye, &ldquo;I will take my leave so that I may return to my leisure. It was absolutely terrific to meet my new neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, the dragon turns. Ankkharavathyr the Magnificent takes a high dive off the edge of the cliff, spreading his wings and turning into a graceful spinning dive into the lava Fly check: 27. With a splash of hot magma, he disappears under the surface once again. Ink gives an unimpressed grunt.</p>
<p>Anasatri puts her hands on her hips, &ldquo;Well! That was...something!&rdquo; She gives Fury a bemused look, &ldquo;Congrats on the new neighbor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury beamed. &ldquo;That was a <em>real dragon</em>! <em>And</em> we&rsquo;re neighbors! And potentially trading partners! And he&rsquo;s not trying to set Surt on fire, because that would be really annoying! Oh, this is amazing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ink glances back and forth between the two, then merely sighs. He glances back up at the sun and squints through the protective shield of shadows around him, &ldquo;Can head back when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready. Thank you, Ink. You&rsquo;re amazing, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ink's smile returns just slightly, "Okay."</p>
<p>With another needlessly dramatic casting of Teleport, Ink returns the group to the exact same spot in the breakfast hall that they left from.</p>
<p>"Back," he explains needlessly. </p>
<p>Fury blinked. "I forgot to present Ankkh with the cake I brought." She hauled the satchel off her back, and pulled a circular metal tray -- much wider than the satchel itself -- out, before dropping it neatly in front of the two confused office staffers who had been eating breakfast when the trio popped back in. "Who wants cake?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh cake!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then Fury and Ink learned just how much cake Anasatri can pack away. They were impressed.</p>
<p>-FIN-</p>
<p>Postscript:</p>
<p>"So... how did you find out my name without breaking the ritual?"</p>
<p>"It is a clever spell, but not as clever as me. I used a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mask-from-divination/">mask</a> to fool a mask. When I overheard your name, the ritual did not trigger because it did not know I existed.</p>
<p>"The trigger is revealing, not knowing. It cannot be revealed to me, because I know. So you are safe from me.</p>
<p>"Circumstances also helped. Deities don't follow the same rules we do."</p>
<p>"...Okay, so that made sense right up until you said 'deities', and now I'm completely confused, because I'm pretty sure you're not a deity. Unless you are, but I think everyone would notice if you were. I think. ...I'll admit, theology isn't exactly my specialty."</p>
<p>Ink blinks at her.</p>
<p>"Not me. The voice you heard, at the end of the vision. It was Calestros. You didn't know?"</p>
<p>"How would I know what Calestros sounds like? How do <em>you</em> know what Calestros sounds like, anyway?</p>
<p>"Anyway.... I mean, I wouldn't... I guess it would make sense logically that something like this would have gotten her attention. She's... likely to notice if someone accidentally sets fire to a large number of her people."</p>
<p>Ink stared blankly at Fury. "She loves her children."</p>
<p>"Maybe that was a warning, then. I'm clearly not the best at ritual magic; after all, I was the spark that set Muspelham on fire.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying I shouldn't have stopped that ritual... but I'm definitely responsible for what happened. And maybe Calestros is trying to warn me before I make things worse."</p>
<p>"Do not blame yourself. Trust me. Perhaps you should consider Her words again."</p>
<p>"She said I was the spark, out of three components -- spark, tinder, and fuel. ...It&rsquo;s hard not to see that as, well, saying the change was kinda my fault -- at least a little bit -- even if the alternative was worse. Far worse, probably; I still don't know what he was trying to do. And even if I deflected whatever he was up to... people still died. A lot of people. And no one asked to change like this."</p>
<p>Ink spends a solid five minutes staring at her after that.</p>
<p>"Neither did I."</p>
<p>"...So you changed, too? What... Wait, forget it. Sorry. I don't mean to pry, and your secrets are -- you might be in danger if you reveal them. That and your sister would probably get annoyed. "</p>
<p>"Yes.</p>
<p>"Can't change what happened, only what's next. Only learn from mistakes. Mine was... hubris. What was yours?"</p>
<p>"...Hubris. I thought I'd set a trap, and I'm the one who walked into it. ...I've been noticing myself doing that a lot, honestly -- jumping to conclusions, not thinking things through, letting my reach exceed my grasp." Fury smiled. "I guess I've always been like that, honestly."</p>
<p>"So what will you do now?"</p>
<p>"Get back up, dust myself off, and keep trying, I guess," Fury said. She gave Ink a sidelong glance. "Or call you over, so I can chase dragons while you do all of the actual work."</p>
<p>Ink nods, "Only you can do it. Me? Only help." He rubs his chin, "Unless I start charging for it..."</p>
<p>"Oh? And whatever would I pay you with?" the Fury said. She tapped a finger against her lips. "I suppose I could give you Firedancing lessons... though you did ruin my shirt this morning, so we're probably even for now..."</p>
<p>"I am a terrible dancer."</p>
<p>"I could teach you! You can't let being terrible at something stop you from trying -- otherwise you might give up before you give yourself a migraine for three months, or fill the night sky with fireworks unintentionally, or accidentally catch a whole city on fire.... Okay, maybe I'm not the best one to be giving advice on 'never giving up.' "</p>
<p>Ink stares at her, "Killed a tree older than recorded time, temporarily deafened my sister, and um... this." Gestures at himself, "Never give up. Magic is hard."</p>
<p>Fury nodded. "Magic is hard."</p>
