<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Fire Elves ain&rsquo;t got no problems</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Investment): Hanging Gardens [the Hunger]</p>
<p><em>Includes Upgrade from Economic Action (Fall Year 1)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>It is clear to the Hunger that continued improvements to Surt&rsquo;s waterways are necessary if the settlement is to be agriculturally independent. The Aqua Via is a good step forward, but as it is, the village&rsquo;s agricultural capabilities are limited -- and the city&rsquo;s stored supplies are dwindling fast. Time to get a little more&hellip; creative.</p>
<p>Last season&rsquo;s research into sulfur has emphasized a problem in the original approach, but finding fertile soil to enhance in the Burning Maar is somewhat difficult. That&rsquo;s when inspiration strikes -- by thoroughly emulsifying the city&rsquo;s ash (preferably waste ash from the filters, as there is some evidence that molds and mushrooms seem to enjoy the stuff) with waste and food scraps, it might be possible to <em>create</em> fertile soil, and then spread it into carefully designed rooftop enclosures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, provisions must be made for supporting livestock in the Burning Maar&rsquo;s harsh climate. The Hunger also begins construction of &ldquo;cavern pens&rdquo;, taking advantage of the relative coolness and security of the nearby mountainsides to provide safe places where animals can be stored nearby (but not too nearby).</p>

<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Espionage): Sheathed Blades [The Terror]</p>
<p>Having heard little from the Blade Elves in the past year, and aware that another &ldquo;potluck&rdquo; was scheduled for the end of next season, the Terror dispatched a few clever soldiers to investigate the Fort, and see if they&rsquo;re planning on conducting military operations anytime soon. The goal here is low-profile scouting; returning unscathed is overall more important than detailed information retrieval.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Military Science (Drill): Civil Protection [The Terror]</p>
<p><em>Includes Bonus Die from Political Action (Fall Year 1)</em></p>
<p>In the wake of the Ashwalker&rsquo;s sudden success, the Terror takes the initiative, ordering that the most dedicated (and angry) elements of the village&rsquo;s Civile Praesidium be trained into a new Ashkin formation -- and also effectively attempting to steal Ashwalker Tsun&rsquo;s thunder. This will help fortify Surt, and also remind everyone who the leaders of the Fire Elves are, all without forcing any member of the Triumvirate to directly involve themselves in any &ldquo;political parties.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Magic): Search Functions [The Fury]</p>
<p><em>Includes Setback Die from Mental Action (Fall Year 1)</em></p>
<p>Frustrated by the mediocre results of the most recent pathfinding expedition (not to mention the harrowing cliffside disaster), the Fury determines that a new approach is in order -- if finding resources manually is a slow and treacherous affair, perhaps a more magical approach will lend greater results? She gathers Surt&rsquo;s local magi, and begins research into rituals that will assist in the location of major mineral veins. The damage to the city&rsquo;s labs is a setback, but the Fury decides that the rewards for a successful scanning ritual may be worth the risk.</p>

<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
<h3>Winter Year 1 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Results-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>Turning a barren, toxic, flame-scarred wasteland into a fertile garden is no small task, even for someone like the Hunger. Even he, along with your increasingly more bold civil planning committee, aren&rsquo;t able to pull it off in a scant few months. The plans to compost the city&rsquo;s waste with ash doesn&rsquo;t pan out, and the first few test gardens fail within a few weeks. After some time the Hunger is able to determine that there are trace amounts of alchemical substances in the ash that are extremely toxic, even in small amounts. The Hunger has the werewithal to realize that this is also the case in the water filtration system, and he is able to determine how to purify the ash before anybody in the city starts getting sick.</p>
<p>While the attempts to build the hanging gardens don&rsquo;t succeed this turn, the civil planning committee&rsquo;s momentum is not disrupted. Progress is made, and plans and processes are improved. You <em>do not </em>lose the upgrade this time, and will get it again the next time you attempt to improve the Aqua Via. Plans have also improved enough that the next attempt will also reduce difficulty by one.</p>
<p>In addition, while the caverns aren&rsquo;t quite cool enough, the committee believes if a small amount of water from the Via in the mountains is diverted it may cool the caves enough to safely store livestock or other heat sensitive material. This will happen automatically the next time you improve the Via (unless you want to make it an Aspect itself.)</p>
<p><strong>Political-</strong> Your soldiers return successful, having gotten a full report on the Blade elves without being detected. They had to adjust tactics, as it seems that the Blade elves are still using military scouts to search for spies. One of your soldiers went plainclothes and snuck in with a group of farmers entering the fort with their food shipments. Once inside, security was&hellip; well, lax isn&rsquo;t the right word but as long as he kept his head down he was able to get a good look at what all was going on.</p>
<p><strong>Fort Alfyr</strong> currently has the following stats-</p>
<p>A long abandoned decaying Lycan fort on a rocky coastline has been turned into a modest town. The town is growing and just beginning to thrive, while the Fort is being slowly returned to its former glory.</p>
<p><strong>Aspects:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fort Alfyr, Updated Once: </strong>The fortress itself has been refreshed. The concrete and earth defensive walls have been rebuilt, and the defensive fortifications have been updated. She is an up to date and effective defensive structure now. Defensive military actions involving the fort itself receive a boost die.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Barracks, Training ground</strong>: The blade elves appear to be developing the barracks they built earlier into a training ground for new troops and specifically officers, building classrooms and drill fields within the fort..</p>
<p><strong>Port:</strong> The blade elves have constructed a simple system of docks, which they are currently using for a humble fleet of fishing vessels.</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong>: Town</p>
<p><strong>Garrison:</strong> Currently full with Alpha and Bravo Divisions.</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Territory</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aspects:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coastline:</strong> Fort Alfyr exists on the coast.</p>
<p><strong>River Mouth:</strong> Fort Alfyr is stationed on the mouth of the Goldfall river.</p>
<p>In addition, Bravo division has been brought up to full strength with exclusively Guardselves and appears to be deployed for long-term guard duty on the fort.</p>
<p>It seems that the Blade elves have been busy strengthening the fort and securing their position. While the city&rsquo;s garrison is full, the simple barracks are being expanded into some kind of larger facility. Your spy is not sure what that means.</p>
<p>Your spy also reports something unusual. As he was finishing up his observations, he heard an alarm among the guards. As he fled, he heard the guards yelling about an intruder. Once he managed to flee the fort, he became aware that the guards were searching the opposite side of the city from him. He was also the only one of your spies in the city at the time. Whoever the blade elves found, it wasn&rsquo;t one of yours.</p>
<p><strong>Military- </strong>Congratulations! You have created a new unit of level 3 Ashkin, lumped in with the currently existing Division. The political side of the recruitment is a bit more complicated. The Terror favors the most dedicated, outspoken, and angry - who also just happen to be some of the biggest Ashkin supporters. There is significant whinging about &ldquo;forced conscription&rdquo; and whatnot, but military discipline keeps most in like. Military punishment works on the rest.</p>
<p>While an actual military formation of Ashkin is technically a win for Tsun, this accomplishes several things. For starters, some of the most radical Ashkin supporters are now solidly enmeshed in a military command structure where it&rsquo;s far easier for the Triumvirate to keep an eye on them. Secondly, these Ashkin supporters are taken away from influential civilian jobs as they are now full time soldiers. Finally, it cements the idea that while they are an Ashkin oriented group, the Praesidium are firmly under Triumvirate control.</p>
<p>Despite their initial complaints, this new unit is quite enthusiastic to get started. Any actions involving this unit or the Praesidium next turn will get a bonus die.</p>
<p><strong>Mental-</strong> Congratulations! You have developed the ritual <strong>detect ores!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Risk- </strong>Low</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>- 15 squares</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong>- Up to 4 squares, which must be touching</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty</strong>- 2</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>- This ritual will tell you which, if any, of the targeted squares contain any Aspects related to usable deposits of valuable minerals. It will not tell you the specific Aspects or their exact location in the square, only that they exist and which squares they are in.</p>
<p>There was, however, a small mishap in the research procedure. As it turns out, you needed to be a little more specific than just &ldquo;minerals.&rdquo; In the first &ldquo;dress rehearsal&rdquo; of the ritual, the ritual leader (obviously the Fury) becomes briefly aware of the exact location of literally every single piece of solid material in a thirty mile radius.</p>
<p>She manages to abort the ritual and will be fine, but will be nursing a migraine for a few oh, months. Still salty about the rockslide, the Fury is just not having a good year. Any actions involving her next turn take a <strong>setback die.</strong></p>
<p>The Fury, however is not the only one who is having a bad month&hellip;</p>
