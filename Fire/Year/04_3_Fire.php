<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Fire Elves are the problems</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Enrichment): Content Filters [the Hunger and Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p>As wondrous as the Aqua Via is&hellip; its also one of several &ldquo;vulnerable spots&rdquo; throughout the town of Surt that a clever, espionage-oriented enemy could use against the town. Time to add some additional security (hopefully as quietly as possible).</p>
<p>To that end, the Hunger organizes with the Praesidium (Tsun can come along too &mdash; Hunger&rsquo;s magnanimous like that) to bolsters the defenses around certain key areas within Surt. The gates and major thoroughfares get additional security, and new patrols are set out to scout the nearby Marr for secret caches or attempts to break through or bypass the roadway fortifications. A few of the rooftop farms are purchased, and repurposed to produce government-ordered crops that can be easily stockpiled, while the Praesidium hires the farmers and sells the excess. Experienced patrollers are assigned to explore some of the caverns beneath Surt; those too winding or too narrow to be properly explored are sealed with concrete.</p>
<p>Amidst all of this, the Hunger carefully redesigns the filters for the Aqua Via to turn black in the presence of the Affliction (and a few other colors if prominent poisons such as cyanide are introduced), and replaced all of them as quietly and carefully as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): Troubleshooter [Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p>New house, fancy clothing, ostentatious bling, awkward encounters with foreigners who are unlikely to ever come back &mdash; what&rsquo;s not to love?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer: paying for it.</p>
<p>As much as Barry wants to relax in the lap of luxury and enjoy his newly elevated position, his supporters in the Firebirds have other ideas. He &ldquo;needs to be a symbol of Imperial power,&rdquo; they say; he &ldquo;needs to get his face into the public eye&rdquo;, &ldquo;catch the city&rsquo;s attention&rdquo;, &ldquo;be the Phoenix Lord the Surtians think they deserve.&rdquo; He needs to schmooze.</p>
<p>From Barry&rsquo;s point of view, that&rsquo;s not too bad of a price. Schmoozing is something he loves. Or at least, its tangentially related to things he enjoys (drinking and romance); that&rsquo;s not quite the same thing, but its pretty close.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s the fact that practically anything he does that does not specifically involve danger or excitement will rapidly collapse into danger and excitement regardless of how he feels about it. But that won&rsquo;t happen this time, right? Surely his luck has changed, and fickle fortune won&rsquo;t immediately drag him into another near-death-experience or six just because he went outside, right? There&rsquo;s not going to be someone asking for his help as soon as he steps in the door, right?</p>
<p>Of course there is.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=2a8a8d7ddb010010e7a0a08a4896192d">Roll</a>: 3 advantage<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Military Science (Drill): Old Dogs [the Terror]</p>
<p>Time for a different approach.</p>
<p>Recruitment is down on new Milites members, and attempting to transfer the old Milites members to a new division has only led to infighting. Instead, the Terror decides it might be better to &ldquo;retrain&rdquo; an old unit that hasn&rsquo;t seen combat in some time &mdash; the heavier elements of the Custodian Guard.</p>
<p>The goal here is not to build an entirely new unit and division from them, but instead retrain them into a &ldquo;standby&rdquo; unit / division that can be restored to function in the event of an emergency. In return, they will get refresher courses on combat (particularly anti-Lycan combat) that should only help them in their normal duties as heavy-response guard units. Captain Doukas will maintain command of the unit, and act as their commander on the field should that ever be needed.</p>
<p>This would also effectively free up the Charred Eagles to be able to move freely throughout Surtian territory, or engage in out-of-territory encounters without leaving the city undefended.</p>

<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Research): Fur Finder [the Fury]</p>
<p>Well, damn.</p>
<p>Ink&rsquo;s out for a while, so no help there. However&hellip; there are other researchers that the Fury knows who might be willing to throw in some ideas. And hey, there&rsquo;s this new post office thing that&rsquo;s great for relaying messages.</p>
<p>The Fury dispatches a letter to Anasatri, asking for her help on the latest attempt to develop a Wolf Elf detection algorithm. If she isn&rsquo;t busy and willing to help, the Fury hopes that the two of them together might actually make some progress. Maybe Anasatri&rsquo;s eclectic knowledge can help where Fury&rsquo;s brute force approach hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Barring that (or in case Anasatri is too busy), the Fury decides that this whole &ldquo;lingering scanner&rdquo; thing is part of the problem. Why not &ldquo;cause every Wolf Elf within a large area &mdash; let&rsquo;s say thirty miles, or city-sized if it has to be smaller &mdash; to produce green smoke (a five-foot square of <em>fog cloud </em>or <em>stinking cloud</em>?) for the next twenty minutes&rdquo;? She&rsquo;d have to recast it repeatedly, but maybe the Wolf Elves would get the hint and clear out after the first round.</p>
<p>And if this doesn&rsquo;t work, the Fury decides she&rsquo;s going to take a season off.</p>

<p><strong>End of Turn&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Winter Year 4 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Results-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>Tsun. <em>TSUN.</em> Tsun is useful for many things. The calm, patient, and diligent world of civil engineering is <em>not</em> one of them. She tries to help, she really does. The fact that she can&rsquo;t seem to stop accusing everyone around her of spying, secretly being a werewolf, or whatever the hells else she can think of just does <em>not</em> help. She <em>still</em> doesn&rsquo;t trust Hunger, or anyone else for that matter, and honestly trust is what cities are built on.</p>
<p>First, the good news. Tsun doesn&rsquo;t want to get in the way of creating ways to detect afflicted. That fight with the emaciated werewolf was her first real experience in fighting lycanthropes. Considering that she almost broke her ankle hitting it in the face, <em>and</em> that was a weak, starving afflicted civil servant and not any kind of well-fed and well-equipped warrior was kind of an eye opener to her. She now has a much better idea of what a real lycanthrope might be capable of. She creates no fuss in Hunger&rsquo;s plan to improve the detection methods of the water filters, and trains her Praesidium members to recognize the signs of potentially contaminated water. Minimal fuss. She still <em>briefly</em> muses that Hunger might be using this as a method of inflicting people. Upon her mentioning this, good ol&rsquo; Conciv Sita grabs a fistfull of formulated filter ash and chews it like it was trail rations, swallowing the whole thing and holding out his arms in a &ldquo;now what?&rdquo; gesture as he struggles his way through the disgusting mouthful. Hilariously, this shuts her up for once. That part of the plan is completed and the filters are installed.</p>
<p>The rest, though, gets bogged down. To be clear, Tsun is <em>not</em> actively trying to sabotage these plans, she simply does not play well with others. This generally vague plan for increasing the viability of the defenses of Surt requires a lot of finesse, and finesse is something that Tsun just&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t have. Between negotiating patrol routes, plugging potential security holes, purchasing private property for government use, or negotiating with homeowners for access to underground facilities, there is no place that Tsun&rsquo;s abrasive personality can&rsquo;t rear its head. It slows down progress a lot.</p>
<p>The Triumvirate believes that this might be a necessary step. If Tsun is ever to become an actually valuable member of society, which she well has the potential to be, she will need to get over this growing pain step. It could be a lot worse, to be honest. Not everything is even her fault. This turns out to genuinely be a bigger project than everyone expected, with far more ground to cover and far more gaps to plug than anyone expected.</p>
<p>Progress <em>is</em> made. Though the described plans are not completed, a lot of the groundwork is laid. The actually level headed members of the Praesidium start making the necessary contacts, projects are started, plans are made. Due to these small but varied and numerous accomplishments, the next Economic check you make to improve Surt&rsquo;s general defenses will receive an <strong>Upgrade.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>Barrabus hates being right. Once <em>again,</em> he&rsquo;s roped into some kind of wild caper the second he leaves the damned door. It&rsquo;s about all he can do to stay within Surt as it is. His fame as an adventurer <em>almost</em> gets him hired by a strange group of Crag who are apparently hiring guides for them to experience the lowlands.</p>
<p>Probably some kind of weird Crag extreme tourism industry. They probably just watch grass grow with cosmic horror. Definitely nothing interesting going on there. Barrabus ignores it.</p>
<p>Oh, and no one dies suspiciously or turns into a werewolf, so that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> Doukas turns out to be a huge asset to this. He&rsquo;s flat out eager to create a defensive force in Surt. He&rsquo;s a veteran of many battles. He has been on both sides of the sacking of a city - both as a defender in Surt, and on the offense at Skaplyndi. He knows how horrible it can be, and he has <em>no</em> desire for anything like that to <em>ever</em> happen in Surt. He is also not alone.</p>
<p>For as much as they are frequently referred to as little more than decorative pickpocket deterrents, there is a core of hardened soldiers at the CG's heart. Spearheaded by Doukas, these elves were almost all experienced blade elf soldiers before the Conflagration and make up the majority of the CG's officers and NCOs. They fought through the height of the war, and have the scars to prove it - both mentally and physically.</p>
<p>Most of them are people who decided to leave war behind, but still craved the structure of military life. The CG was a good fit for them. They have no interest in deploying or going on campaign, but they <em>are</em> fully prepared to lay down their lives in defense of Surt.</p>
<p>From these former soldiers, Doukas is easily able to create an emergency muster unit that is specifically trained to defend the city in the event of a hostile military attack. This new "Division" is attached to Surt. It <em>cannot </em>be moved from Surt and still remain an functional unit. If the soldiers that make up that Division leave the city, it will cease to function as a unit.</p>
<p>There is some amount of controversy here. Most of these CG soldiers were loyalists. Unlike the Charred Eagles, most of these soldiers were part of the blade elf garrison at Muspelham. They did not join the rebels until forced to, when Dreyrugr was at the gates. There is an old wound here, but Doukas manages to get it under control. He makes a surprisingly passionate speech, declaring that the entire purpose of this is to make sure that they never make the same mistake again. It's enough.</p>
<p>Doukas might need a promotion from Captain. He's slowly becoming integral to Surt's physical safety. He's also becoming a popular figure in the military, and is known as an honorable man to just about everyone in Surt. He is known as a former loyalist, but his active role in visibly keeping the blade elves in check during the "occupation" has earned him a reputation as a man of Surt, and a fire elf to his core.</p>
<p>As a man respected by the Triumvirate, the military, the Praesidium, and the average Surtian, he is becoming something of a lynchpin. With his new duty as a military officer, there is significant recognition of his talents as a citizen soldier - and his peculiar low rank. </p>
<p>There's a joke running around - "they finally remembered Doukas has a rank." Captain, after all, is only supposed to be in charge of about 100 soldiers. Hilariously, he has <em>finally </em>been given command of such a unit, but it's on top of everything else. He, of course, is handling all the extra responsibilities quite efficiently.</p>
<p>A surprising amount of eyes are quietly watching Doukas, and wondering how his career will proceed. If he is not somehow recognized for his recent outstanding service, you will receive a <strong>setback die </strong>on any military actions next turn due to generally muffled morale and ambition.</p>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>Congratulations! You have successfully created the ritual <strong>Bad Dog, No Treat!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Risk- </strong>Medium</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>- 5 squares from casting location (Allied Settlement)</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong>- 1 Square</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty</strong>- 1</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>- This ritual will cause any and all wolf elves in the targeted territory to temporarily be surrounded by a stinking orange cloud of sulphuric smoke. This choking acrid substance sticks to and stains skin and clothing with a bright orange pigment does not wash out easily, and produces a foul scent that can be detected for hours or even days after exposure.</p>
<p>While this ritual technically takes place over a very short duration, it can be carefully timed to target (or hopefully target) a specific group of wolf elves or even interrupt a specific known wolf elf activity.</p>
<p>When cast, target both a specific territory and a specific track - Economic, Political, Military, or Mental. Any wolf elf activities in that territory for that turn will have one difficulty die added to their dice pool as their personnel struggle with the noticeable and aggravating smoke.</p>
<p>Note your timing of the effect when you cast the ritual. Causing the effect to take place at a critical moment, such as during a military operation or during an event wolf elf spies are trying to influence, may upgrade the difficulty die to a challenge die.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for spies to evade detection even with this ritual going off. As with all magic, there are countermeasures. If a spy is indoors, able to flee, or able to counter with alchemy or spells of their own, it may not work. This will be decided by nation level dice, and it is <em>not</em> an automatic "detect spies" button.</p>
<p>If it comes down to character scale, this ritual will be treated as a <em>Stinking Cloud</em> spell, except 5 foot radius that is both centered on and travels with each wolf elf in the area. The spell has saving throws and duration as if Fury had used her highest available spell slot to cast it, and can be countered by any means that could counter Fury actually casting a spell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also at character scale, affected creatures are marked with orange stains and a foul scent. The scent provides a +10 bonus to any opposed perception checks to identify them by scent. The pigment immediately ruins most disguises and must be covered with another disguise check at a -5 penalty. These effects can only be removed with magic or alchemical detergents and last 2d4 days.</p>
<p>Note that this is Medium Risk magic. Threat will be taken into full account when determining mishaps that could occur with this spell, and hoo boy surrounding potentially hundreds of people in stinking sulphur clouds has some potential side effects. The spell could target the wrong population, target the <em>entire</em> population, or the sheer happenstance of random fart clouds firing out around settlements could have consequences in and of itself, even if the spell works as intended. That shit's probably flammable.</p>
<p>Thankfully, since the spell is more of a nonlethal deterrent, fatalities and critical damage are unlikely.</p>
<p>Fury sets down her arcane inks and parchments. She looks over her work carefully. She did the bulk of that in like two days of angry scribbling while waiting for Anasatri to reply.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p><br />Turns out, pure, distilled, refined, and utterly petty &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; <em>is</em> a basis for a magic ritual! </p>
<p><strong>Misc: </strong>A letter arrives from <strong>Shadimon:</strong></p>
<p><em>To the Triumvirate,</em></p>
<p><em>I hope this letter finds you well. I find myself in need of advice, and was hoping you had some to give.</em></p>
<p><em>Before the War, we lived in villages that mostly managed themselves. When the Lycans came, we were too disorganized to act.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We need room to spread our wings, and have been expanding our territory here. As that happens, however, we run into the problem of governance. I will not see us isolated and alone again, but our history has no precedents for a single, central government. I know whatever I decide will have to be given to the community for a final decision, but I&rsquo;m at a loss as to what the options are or how to implement them. We have some books from Skaplyndi on the matter, but I would </em><em>very</em><em> much prefer an elven viewpoint.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you,</em></p>
<p><em>Shadimon</em></p>
